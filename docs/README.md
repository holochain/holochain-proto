## End User Guidance
Be patient, grasshopper. Soon there will be applications built to make it easy to use holochains as your distributed database for all your daily needs. Hopefully, these applications will be as easy to find, install, and use as any other software you can think of. However, at the moment, these apps don't exist and holochain is largely for devlopers trying to build these things for you. Check back in Q2 of 2017 for some cool applications.

For now, please [enjoy our FAQ](https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md). :)

## Philosophical Underpinnings
Holochain is a part of a much larger vision for distributed computing to enable quantum leaps in our collective intelligence and abilities for groups to organize themselves on all scales. You can find out more about [Ceptr here](http://ceptr.org).

## Technical Architecture
White paper link
### Architecture Overview
#### 1. The local signed chain:
#### 2. The shared DHT:
#### 3. End-User Applications:

## Developer Resources
How the heck do you start building an app to run on holochains?

### Data schemas
Hmmm...

### Validation Rules
Scripted in [Zygomys](https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys)

### Sockets for Web UI
For now we expect to run these via a web browser UI.
